					<p class="article__text">Finding the right kind of furniture for the children’s room can be a huge challenge.</p>
					<p class="article__text">If you like it, chances are that they won’t. And if they like it, chances are you aren’t willing to put money on it!</p>
					<p class="article__text">However, there is a very valid way around that dilemma. European Style Furniture offers a range of great options for every member of the family, and that includes the little ones. Furniture stores that sell for every room in the house should stock up on ESF Wholesale’s range of high quality European furniture.</p>
					<p class="article__text">It is important that you select furniture that is multi functional and can easily transition from a kid’s bedroom to a teenager’s bedroom with minimum fuss. Your showroom should be able to appeal to the parents as well as the children who will be the primary users of the furniture being sold. And to top it all off, it should look fun, be easy to clean and affordable enough. The parents should not have to break into the college fund to buy their kids some bedroom furniture!</p>

					<p class="article__text">Anyone who has ever had, or lived with, children knows that the little ones have a knack for messing up their rooms. It is important that your furniture should have ample storage space, huge cupboards, and also under-bed storage. It’s a great idea to decorate the vignettes with toy chests as accessories to the actual furniture pieces.</p>
					<p class="article__text">Remember, there are no decorative ‘rules’ as such, when it comes to children’s rooms. Cleanliness is the order of the day. The clean lines, and clutter free designs of modern European furniture can help sell these gems off quickly.</p>
					<p class="article__text">Children love bright colors, so infuse these colors into your store décor and into the bedding, rugs and of course the lighting fixtures. But don’t forget to accent it all with a neutral color that can make the whole room come together beautifully and make the entire color scheme cohesive.</p>

The juvenile furniture at ESF Wholesale promises to deliver all that and a lot more!</p>
